<h1>&gt About</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Kevin Wilder.</p>

<p>I've been a professional hardware engineer (the Verilog-and-Perl writing kind) at <a href="https://nvidia.com">NVIDIA</a> since 2007.
    Before that, I was a BS CompE ('07) at <a href="https://uiuc.edu">UIUC</a>; then, I did a concurrent stint as a MS EE ('14) at <a href="https://stanford.edu">Stanford</a>.</p>

<p> I've generally focused on clock network design -- the digital, state-having pieces between the off-chip oscillator and the clock pin of any general flop -- and the automation thereof.
    Mostly RTL design with glue scripting; a little bit of silicon bringup, timing closure, synthesis, and verification.</p>

<p>My first code shipped with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_200_series">GT218</a>, and I've been involved with GPU stuff ever since.
    I've also helped out with mobile devices, starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegra#Tegra_K1">Tegra K1</a>,
    with a few years spent on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Denver">CPU</a>.
    Currently, I'm focusing on dynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_scaling">frequency</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_voltage_scaling">voltage</a> scaling.
    My dream is to one day meet someone, IRL and outside of work, who knows or cares what either is.</p>

<p>Anyway: everything on this site (thoughts, opinions, content, code, etc) is my own, has been developed without company time or resources, and doesn't necessarily reflect any position of my employer.
    The content domains don't even overlap -- I'm explicitly avoiding the use of any work-gained experience or expertise in the projects and posts here, to keep things fresh / interesting.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you'd like to contact me: <pre>$email = substr($firstName,0,1) . $lastName . "@gmail.com";</pre>
I'll be putting most of my hobby work on <a href="https://github.com/kmwilder">GitHub</a>.<br>
I also try to check <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-wilder-a900ba47">LinkedIn</a> at least once per year, but sometimes forget.</p>
