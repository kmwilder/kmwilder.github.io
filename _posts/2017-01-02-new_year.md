2017 has arrived, and just like every year, it's accompanied by that mostly (but not quite) ignorable urge: "Let's do better than last year. Let's do something _productive_."

Luckily, 2016 set a pretty low bar that I can quickly summarize here and broadcast to the void:
* Started this thing.
* Installed some frameworks / AI stuff, didn't pursue.

I'm not incredibly morose about this, as my personal and professional lives have picked up all that slack. I'm quite happy with, and grateful for, both of those -- though I could probably do with a bit less video gaming. Anyway, they're outside the ill-defined scope of this here vanity project.

So, what better way to kick off the new year than by delivering a content-free side project failure acknowledgement post, a day late to a readership of zero, shaking off all the text entry and git commit dust that accumulated last year? (If you're thinking 'make some minor forward progress, rather than empty talk' then my question was rhetorical.)
