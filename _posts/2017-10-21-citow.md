## PROBLEM STATEMENT

[Chaos in the Old World](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43111/chaos-old-world) is a 4-player (sometimes 5) board
game by [Fantasy Flight Games](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/). It pits the Warhammer universe's four ruinous
powers against each other in a race to dominate mankind.

We've been playing it for a few years, now. It's pretty fun in person -- wins are decided based off of scheming,
trickery, backstabbing, luck -- or, by someone else misplaying and throwing the game. In real time, it's hard to tell.
Given enough time, though, you can plan a lot out in advance. I think the game is more fun when played by forum, which
we've been doing since 2015.

We play via [Vassal](http://www.vassalengine.org/), which lets us run games online
in a P2P fashion (at first), then via a save file shared in Google Drive. Turn notifications and dice rolls are tracked 
via [BoardGameGeek's Play By Forum](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/forum/390984/chaos-old-world/play-forum).
Our first game is [here](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1449547/chaos-old-world-pbf001).

We each have as much time as we need to plan out our next move. It meant [one of our games](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1590779/chaos-old-world-pbf006-horned-rat-edition)
lasted six months across 246 posts, but it also means we can pull off more complicated schemes.

Initially, this just meant that we could calculate dice percentages a few times per game when things got close.

| P(hits &#124; dice)  | 1     | 2    | 3     | 4     |
| ----- |:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **0** | 0.5   | 0.25 | 0.125 | 0.062 |
| **&#8805; 1** | 0.5   | 0.75 |	0.875 |	0.938 |
| **&#8805; 2** | 0.083 | 0.33 |	0.561 |	0.728 |
| **&#8805; 3** | 0.014 | 0.09 |	0.249 |	0.433 |

But, as time went on, more planning was needed. Spreadsheets were useful in tracking
plans (both mine, and anticipating others). You could say I spent a little too much time on this,
but I could say that I like making spreadsheets.

Plus, Khorne has its own, unique set of challenges, best served by some [ad-hoc Perl scripts.](https://github.com/kmwilder/ChaosintheAIWorld/tree/master/scripts)

These are just the solutions I cooked up throughout the years -- I've no visibility into the planning 
mechanisms of my opponents. All I know is:
* It can take quite a bit of time to hash all these possibilities out, manually.
* The others have spent nonzero time crunching numbers / exploring branching decision trees.
* My win record is lower than it should be, given the above mechanisms.

My standard reason for losing has not been any fault of my own, or exceptional play of the winner. No,
they win because some third party throws them the game: some misplay that I did not anticipate (perhaps driven
solely by spite!) works in their favor, 
or fate itself conspires against me with dice rolls beyond reckoning.

## ATTEMPTED SOLUTION

Let's have a computer do all the work: [Chaos in the AI World](https://github.com/kmwilder/ChaosintheAIWorld)

Given the current state of the game, find the move with the best likelihood of victory.

What this requires:
* Some basic simulation environment (representing cards played, dice rolls, etc.)
  * Straightforward, but lots of code for a game so complex. 
* Some mechanism for keeping this simulation environment up to date with the game I'm playing.
  * Probably just a YAML file containing game state, manually culled from BGG posts.
* A way of quickly driving the simulation forward to the end-states, to find a winner.
  * The 'quickly' bit is proving to be problematic.

My problem, currently, is that brute-force searching takes forever. Even a single round isn't
completing in ~10 minutes. My code badly needs optimization: first, general code profiling to see if I'm making
huge mistakes somewhere that kill runtime. After that, I'll need to do some search space culling, possibly
introducing some heuristics.

A writeup on this is to follow.
