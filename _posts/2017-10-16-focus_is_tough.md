I'm happy with the amount I've gotten done lately; if only it were all done on the same project.

We got a little more work done on PROJECT_1... to the point where we're deceivingly close to a MVP.

But then, I got a little distracted, started up PROJECT_2 on my own, and coded most of it...
before realizing it may not be viable. I should probably crunch the numbers before diving in
completely. It was fun, at least, and might still be usable. I was going to do a writeup of the
project so far, do some run time profiling, and then start looking into graph pruning / newbie 
traversal mistakes I'm making...
 
But then, I saw how ugly and half-baked this site was. So, I spent a little too long tweaking formatting,
adding pagination, half-adding tags, and fleshing out whatever I could flesh out. With that out of the way,
I figured I'd make this post in celebration of at least one thing submitted publicly today.

Every one of these META tagged posts is a black mark on my permanent internet record.
