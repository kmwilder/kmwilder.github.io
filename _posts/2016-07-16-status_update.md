Completed tasks, March 2016:

* Set up my crappy Ubuntu server from scavenged parts. VNC still segfaults a bit when doing fancy graphical stuff, but otherwise seems OK.
* Set this thing up, as an introduction to basic git/github (as a 10-year Perforce user and 0.5-year git user, I don't see why anyone would use git for anything.)
* Started messing with some sample datasets in OpenCV.

Goals, March 2016:

* Fix TightVNC segfault issues.
* Run full OpenCV eigenface tests, just to get a better feel of where to go.
* Decide on web tech stack. Get skeleton web interface up and running.
* Flesh out full plan for next few months.

Results, March 2016 - July 2016:

* Moved into new house.
* Worked hard @ day job.
* DOOM, Total War: Warhammer, Fallout 4, DotA, WoW, etc.
* Decided to fully abandon old project, for now.

New Goals, July 2016:

* Start new, different project.
* Is this wishful thinking, again?
* Will it always be?
