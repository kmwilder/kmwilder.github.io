So, uh. Here's a blog.

I don't really have a platform, agenda, or really much of anything interesting to say that isn't already being said, more eloquently and interestingly, elsewhere.

Why am I making this?

**1.) At the start of this, I know nothing about practical software engineering / web development.**  

I know a little basic trivia, of course: fancy people use fancy frameworks in JavaScript or Ruby, wherein they load up Eclipse and Ctrl-Space their way to a CRUD app yielding limitless revenues, exciting lifestyles, acquisitions and acqui-hires, a house in California, and possibly profits. My comfort zone (aka entire professional life) is Perl and Verilog via vim, yielding generally on-schedule GPU/CPU/SOCs capable of solid perf, in an ever-improving thermal/power envelope, at a reasonable price point.  

Maybe I'll record all the stuff I'm forced to brush up on as I attempt to create some kind of useful software on the web? Maybe it'll be useful to me, so I can look back and see definite progress? Maybe it'll be interesting to any other person in the same boat? Maybe it's essentially just wishful thinking and budding narcissism?

**2.) My non-technical written communication skills have gone to shit.**

Not that my technical written communication skills are incredible, but I at least get to fight off that atrophy on the job.

This seems way harder -- rather than presenting facts, presenting some... narrative(?) to an audience of an empty set of strangers?

In fifth grade, I won a writing contest for a short story, and in my junior year of college was in a class on creative writing for a day before being terrified out of it. (They made us _share_ our writing -- _**by reading it aloud!!!**_)

It's kinda nice to write in sentences and paragraphs, occasionally. Not that I'll be dusting off the Chicago Manual of Style, or even using actual paragraphs, here. The... punctuation... is refreshing?

**3.) Tech folks are supposed to have some kind of web presence, for self-promotion that leads to great success (guaranteed).**

I would like some great success.
